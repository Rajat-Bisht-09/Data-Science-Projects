# YULU Hypothesis Testing

This project focuses on **hypothesis testing** and **data analysis** using the YULU dataset. The main goal is to analyze the data through **visualization** and apply various statistical tests to verify hypotheses about the relationships between variables. 

## Key Steps:
1. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visual representations of the dataset were created to understand data distributions and relationships.

2. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Analyzed individual variables to understand their properties (e.g., distribution, central tendencies, spread).

3. **Bivariate Analysis**:
   - Explored relationships between two variables using various plots and statistical techniques.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Applied statistical tests to check for significant relationships and differences among groups:
     - **Chi-Square Test**: Used for checking associations between categorical variables.
     - **ANOVA**: Applied to compare means across multiple groups.
     - **Kruskal-Wallis Test**: A non-parametric method to compare medians across groups.
     - **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: Used to test for normality of the data.
     - **Levene Test**: Used for variance check between the groups.

## Tools and Libraries:
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations.
- **SciPy** and **Statsmodels** for hypothesis testing and statistical analysis.

## Conclusion:
This project provides insights into the relationships within the dataset using comprehensive statistical methods. It highlights the importance of choosing the right statistical tests based on the nature of the data.
