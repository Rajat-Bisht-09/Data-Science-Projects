## PM10 Air Quality Estimation 
Air quality is a critical factor in determining public health, with PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter of 10 microns or less) being one of the most harmful pollutants. Exposure to high levels of PM10 can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular issues. The challenge is that monitoring stations often provide limited coverage, making it difficult to accurately predict air quality across a large region.
