# Machine-Learning-Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects, each focused on solving real-world problems using various algorithms and techniques. The projects span multiple domains, including regression, classification, and clustering, and utilize a wide range of datasets. Each project includes:

- **Problem Statements:** Clearly defined objectives and challenges for each project.
- **Data Exploration:** In-depth analysis and visualization of the dataset to uncover insights.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
- **Evaluation:** Detailed performance metrics and model comparisons.
- **Conclusion:** Key findings and potential improvements for each project.

The goal of these projects is to demonstrate practical applications of machine learning and to provide well-documented code that can be easily understood and reused by others.
