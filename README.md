# Data Science Projects: Machine Learning, Hypothesis Testing, and Data Visualization

This repository is a curated collection of **data science projects** that showcase skills in **machine learning**, **hypothesis testing**, and **data visualization**. Each project demonstrates a systematic approach to solving data-driven problems, with detailed steps for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building.

- **Problem Statements:** Clearly defined objectives and challenges for each project.
- **Data Exploration:** In-depth analysis and visualization of the dataset to uncover insights.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
- **Evaluation:** Detailed performance metrics and model comparisons.
- **Conclusion:** Key findings and potential improvements for each project.

### Key Highlights:
1. **Machine Learning**:
   - A variety of supervised and unsupervised learning projects focused on predictive modeling, classification, and clustering.
   - Includes models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and more other techniques.

2. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Projects involving the application of statistical tests such as Chi-Square, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Shapiro-Wilk to validate assumptions and test relationships within datasets.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Comprehensive visual analysis using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Power BI to create insightful representations of complex datasets.
   - Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations used for enhanced understanding of data patterns and trends.

Each project folder contains detailed documentation, source code, and relevant datasets, providing a complete solution from data cleaning to final analysis and interpretation.

The goal of these projects is to demonstrate practical applications and to provide well-documented code that can be easily understood and reused by others.
