## Bike Trips (Data Visualiztion using Python)
A bike-sharing service is a shared transport service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis for a certain price or free.
Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a station and return it at another station belonging to the same system.
With the rise of urban mobility solutions, bike-sharing services have become a popular mode of transport in cities like New York. Understanding the patterns and behaviors of bike trips can provide valuable insights for both service providers and users. 

This project aims to analyze and visualize data from a New York-based bike-sharing company. By leveraging Python for data visualization, we explore trip duration, station usage, user demographics, and time-based trends to help uncover meaningful patterns and improve decision-making for bike-sharing services.

The dataset consists of â‰ˆ 1.6M rows and 11 columns. The attributes are:
| Feature     | Description                     |
| :---------- | :------------------------------ |
| `starttime`| the time when a trip starts (in NYC local time)      |
| `stoptime` | the time when a trip is over (in NYC local time)    |
| `startstationid`| a unique code to identify a station where a trip begins      |
| `startstationname`| the name of a station where a trip begins      |
| `endstationid `| a unique code to identify a station where a trip is over     |
| `endstationname ` | the name of a station where a trip is over   |
| `usertype `| the type of bike user    |
| `bikeid `| a unique code to identify a bike user     |
| `gender `| gender of the user      |
| `age ` | age of the user    |
| `trip_duration `| the duration of a trip (in minutes)      |

The following questions need to be explored through data visualization:
- What are the busiest hours for bike trips?
- Which stations have the highest number of trip starts and stops?
- What is the distribution of trip durations?
- Is there a difference in trip duration between different user types?
- How does age affect trip duration?
- What are the gender distributions among bike users?
- What is the average trip duration by gender?
- How does the trip count vary across different days of the week?
- Which stations are most popular for bike trips for different user types (e.g., Subscriber vs. Customer)?
- Are there certain bikes that are used more frequently than others?
- Does trip duration vary by bike ID?
- Is there a seasonal or time-of-day pattern in trip starts?
- What is the distribution of trip durations by user age?
- How does the number of trips vary by station over time?
- Are there differences in trip duration between male, female, and other gender users?

## How to Download the Dataset from Kaggle to Google Colab

To download a dataset from Kaggle directly to Google Colab, follow these steps:

### 1. **Get Kaggle API Credentials**
   - Go to your [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/account).
   - Scroll down to the **API** section and click on **Create New API Token**.
   - A file named `kaggle.json` will be downloaded. This file contains your Kaggle API credentials.

### 2. **Upload the API Token to Google Colab**
   - Open your Google Colab notebook.
   - Run the following code to upload the `kaggle.json` file:

   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   files.upload()
   ```

   - A dialog will appear where you can upload your `kaggle.json` file.

### 3. **Set Up Kaggle in Colab**
   - After uploading the `kaggle.json` file, run the following commands to set up Kaggle and download the dataset:

   ```python
   # Create a Kaggle directory
   !mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
   
   # Move the kaggle.json file to the .kaggle directory
   !cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
   
   # Set the permissions of the API token file
   !chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   ```

### 4. **Download the Dataset**
   - Navigate to the Kaggle dataset page you want to download. For example, for a dataset at `https://www.kaggle.com/dataset-name`, you can get the dataset identifier (found in the URL).
   - Use the following command to download the dataset (replace `dataset-name` with the actual dataset name):

   ```python
   !kaggle datasets download -d dataset-name
   ```

### 5. **Unzip the Dataset (If Necessary)**
   - If the dataset is zipped, you can unzip it using the following command:

   ```python
   !unzip dataset-name.zip
   ```

### 6. **Load the Dataset**
   - After downloading and unzipping the dataset, you can load it into your Colab environment using pandas:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.read_csv('path_to_file.csv')
   ```
