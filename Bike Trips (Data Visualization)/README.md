## Bike Trips (Data Visualiztion using Python)
A bike-sharing service is a shared transport service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis for a certain price or free.
Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a station and return it at another station belonging to the same system.
With the rise of urban mobility solutions, bike-sharing services have become a popular mode of transport in cities like New York. Understanding the patterns and behaviors of bike trips can provide valuable insights for both service providers and users. 

This project aims to analyze and visualize data from a New York-based bike-sharing company. By leveraging Python for data visualization, we explore trip duration, station usage, user demographics, and time-based trends to help uncover meaningful patterns and improve decision-making for bike-sharing services.

The dataset consists of â‰ˆ 1.6M rows and 11 columns. The attributes are:
| Feature     | Description                     |
| :---------- | :------------------------------ |
| `starttime`| the time when a trip starts (in NYC local time)      |
| `stoptime` | the time when a trip is over (in NYC local time)    |
| `startstationid`| a unique code to identify a station where a trip begins      |
| `startstationname`| the name of a station where a trip begins      |
| `endstationid `| a unique code to identify a station where a trip is over     |
| `endstationname ` | the name of a station where a trip is over   |
| `usertype `| the type of bike user    |
| `bikeid `| a unique code to identify a bike user     |
| `gender `| gender of the user      |
| `age ` | age of the user    |
| `trip_duration `| the duration of a trip (in minutes)      |
